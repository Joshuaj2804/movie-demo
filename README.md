# MovieDemo
This app will be for demo purposes, listing movies and some general information about them.

The app that contains an immense list of movies, all segregrated nicely by pages and has a lazy loading feature, so you don't get bombarded with a wall of results
as soon as you open the app.
The app is planned to have a landing page as well, following the design cues of Android Material design.

This data is called from the Rapid Api database : "https://rapidapi.com/SAdrian/api/moviesdatabase/"

The app calls upon the api of titles and title id to get the information and display it in RecyclerView and to click and show general information

Version 1.0 : 
- not able to show much data
- weird bug of crash when null data is found (more testing needed)
- no animations included
